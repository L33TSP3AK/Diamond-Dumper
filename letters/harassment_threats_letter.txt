Dear Telegram Support,

I am writing to report the account [Account Username] for engaging in cyberbullying and doxxing. This account has been repeatedly targeting [target's username] with abusive messages, threats, and the dissemination of personal information.

The attached evidence includes screenshots of the abusive messages, threats, and doxxed information. This behavior is not only harmful but also illegal and can have severe consequences for the victim.

I request that you take immediate action to ban this account and remove any harmful content. Additionally, I urge you to implement measures to protect users from cyberbullying and doxxing, such as stronger reporting mechanisms and faster response times.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
