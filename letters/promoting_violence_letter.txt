Dear Telegram Staff,

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding a [group/channel/account] on your platform that is actively promoting violence. This content is disturbing, harmful, and poses a serious threat to the safety and well-being of your users.

[Provide specific examples of violent content, such as screenshots, links, or descriptions of the posts.]

I understand that Telegram values freedom of speech, but there is a clear line between expressing opinions and inciting violence. The content I have observed falls squarely into the latter category.

I kindly request that you take immediate action to remove this [group/channel/account] from your platform and investigate the individuals responsible for its creation and maintenance.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this urgent matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
